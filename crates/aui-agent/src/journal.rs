//! The battle journal: an owned snapshot of every decision, executed step,
//! stale discard, clause advance, and outcome of a run.
//!
//! The agent pushes events; the host drains them once via
//! [`Agent::take_journal`] and `aui-cli` maps them to `aui-dojo` diary
//! lines. Plain Rust, no serde, no IO — the loop stays allocation-bounded
//! and the on-disk format stays a CLI concern.
