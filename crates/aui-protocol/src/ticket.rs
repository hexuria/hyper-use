//! ActionTicket: the product boundary between guard Allow and host actuation.
//!
//! Ultra-Instinct MCP never clicks. On [`crate::GuardDecision::Allow`] the runtime
//! issues a ticket. The host (or an invisible executor interceptor) must
//! revalidate that ticket against a fresh observation, then click the **exact**
//! target. If the world or target fingerprint drifted, the ticket is invalid
//! and nothing is pressed.
//!
//! Direction (hard gates before rank): occluded / front-layer / disabled /
//! hidden / wrong ancestry / stale ticket should be impossible evidence, not
//! score penalties. Ranking only chooses among viable candidates. Today's
//! `buried_better_label` path remains until that split lands; the ticket is
//! the enforcement lease regardless.
