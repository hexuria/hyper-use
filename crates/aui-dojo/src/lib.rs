#![forbid(unsafe_code)]
//! The dojo: ultra-instinct's learning loop over its own battle diaries.
//!
//! The agent never touches files — it emits journal events; `aui-cli`
//! maps them into [`line::DiaryLine`]s and a [`diary::DiaryWriter`]. The
//! diary is the evidence base the replay arena, lesson store, and belt
//! exams all read. Lessons only ever adjust evidence inside the finite
//! `ActionSpace`; they never pick an off-menu action and never bypass the
//! guard/ticket/executor chain (the anti-drift rules own that path).
