//! The "what counts as a win" oracle (issue #49, open decision).
//!
//! A win is verified evidence, never a DONE choice:
//!
//! - **click** — verified effect (`Success` / `StateChanged` / `Navigation`)
//!   *and* the acted label names the clause's target
//!   ([`aui_policy::label_names_target`]);
//! - **type / select** — read-back `Success` (the observed value matches the
//!   payload);
//! - **scroll / wait / done / blocked** — never a win on their own; a
//!   `… while M` clause win is the marker leaving the screen, which is a
//!   clause-level fact owned by the loop, not this predicate.
//! - **human correction** — the strongest signal; recorded as a diary
//!   `correction` line by tools outside the loop, never written here.
