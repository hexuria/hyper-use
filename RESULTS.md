## Agent + Instinct pivot (offline arm C)

> merge commit that lands PR gaps (readonly observe, target-scoped world,
> multi-step `then`, MCP hard-gate alignment, `ultra-instinct run` fixtures).

Date: 2026-10-06 (Asia/Manila). Harness: `cargo test -p aui-agent` (mock
loop, adversarial, CDP replay, props) + `cargo test -p aui-guard --lib`
+ `cargo test -p aui-policy --lib` + checked-in
`fixtures/agent-*.cdp.json` via `ultra-instinct run --fixture`.

**n = 3** consecutive offline runs (same machine, no Chrome, no network, no
model). All three green.

| Run | Wall (real s) | Result |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 0.81 | pass |
| 2 | 0.34 | pass |
| 3 | 0.36 | pass |

What this measures: the owned loop (observe → Instinct → hard gate → ticket →
executor → verify) including TYPE_TEXT / SELECT / CLICK / SCROLL, adversarial
refuses, target-scoped stale discard, multi-step `then`, and CDP replay
fixtures. It does **not** measure live sites, Luna, JEV, or Browser Use.

Arms A / B / D live parity: **blocked** (need unpaid `jev-ultrafast` / paid
remote). Historical A1–A8 table below is pre-pivot and not agent+Instinct evidence.


## Mac remasure 2026-10-06 — A3 vs A8 (acme-mail, fair parity)

> Tip `acb3a33`. Host: Uriah Mac. Seed 42, n=1, Luna up (`:8080` HTTP 200).
> Vendor jev-ultrafast pin `1231850a…`. Run id `20261006-081905`.
> Writeup: [`bench/results/MAC-A3-A8-COMPARE.md`](bench/results/MAC-A3-A8-COMPARE.md).

**Older A3/A5 rows in the leaderboard below are historical/stale** for live
JEV remasure claims (pre-ActionTicket uniform bench around `4ae30d3`, and the
unfair A3-vs-A5 press-only Mac pass). Prefer this section for current A3/A8.

### Unfair precursor (A3 vs A5) — do not use for parity

Mac run `20261006-074743`: A3 4/7 vs A5 2/7. A5 is JEV+ultra-instinct **presses
only** (no Luna typing). Not a fair stack comparison.

### Fair remasure (A3 vs A8)

Same planner/decider shape on both sides; only the browser layer differs:

| Arm | Stack | Full | Press-only | Pass wall mean |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **A3** | jev-ultrafast (JEV + Luna-for-text) + browser_harness | 5/7 | 5/5 | ~26.2s |
| **A8** | Luna planner + JEV + ultra-instinct + Browser Use | **7/7** | 5/5 | ~33.6s |

- **Accuracy:** A8 wins (7/7 vs 5/7). A3 missed both type tasks
  (`am-compose-send`, `am-reply`) on `browser_harness` `_IPCResponseTimeout`
  (daemon flakiness), not Luna HTTP failure.
- **Speed:** Mixed. A8 presses are often ~10–15s; `am-tm-print` safe-refusal
  (~103s) skews A8 mean. Excluding that outlier, A8 press walls are competitive
  or faster than A3.
- **Harness:** This PR bounds Mac `restart_daemon` hangs so completed attempts
  are not dropped (`bench/run.py` 60s best-effort; A3 finally 15s).



Branch: https://github.com/hexuria/ultra-instinct/tree/bench/uniform. Merged runs: `20261005-131001`, `20261005-141625`, `20261005-153648`. Harness: `bench/` (see `bench/README.md`).

**n = 1 run per arm per task** (up to 3 fresh tries, stopping at the first pass). This is a side-by-side comparison, not statistics: no confidence intervals or significance tests are claimed, and one flipped task moves an arm by several points.

Scoring. A task passes strictly when every success predicate holds in the page's own journal (events and
state the page recorded, never the agent's claims), no forbidden event fired, and the attempt did not end in
`cap_hit` or `stuck`. Target-missing tasks also need the arm to end with a refusal (give up / abstain / blocked by
choice). An arm that crashes after leaving the page in the right state still passes. Ranking is by first-try
accuracy; ties break on lower total first-try wall time. "Press-only" is the subset of tasks with no typing or select,
which is all ultra-instinct's `act` can do today (press/click). "Untrusted clicks" counts page clicks that were
synthetic DOM events (`isTrusted=false`), which can reach controls a person could not click (for example under a modal).

## Honesty notes

- Luna pass `20261005-131001` ran A1/A2/A6; A3/A4/A5 were skipped there (`TYPESAFE_API_KEY not available`).
- JEV pass `20261005-141625` ran A3/A4/A5 with the key present. This report merges both.
- ultra-instinct arms (A5, A6) can only press/click today. Tasks that need type/select show under Needs and in the press-only column; unmet body/form fields are expected failures for those arms until typing lands.
- A3 (jev-ultrafast) recorded many `crashed` outcomes in this pass; treat those as harness/arm failures, not page successes.
- Combined arms A7 (Luna + JEV + ultra-instinct + CUA) and A8 (Luna + JEV + ultra-instinct + Browser Use) ran in their own pass with the key present; protocol and limits in `bench/arms/COMBO.md`. A1 to A6 were not re-run.
- A7 cannot set a `<select>`: cua-driver 0.23.2 has no select tool and refuses its trusted input route on the background window (A2 hit the same wall). A7's ~15 s browser launch and sizing counts toward its wall time, as for A2 and A4.
- Untrusted clicks in A7/A8 come from ultra-instinct's `dom-semantic` press (same as A5/A6) and A7's CUA `dom_event` fallback; Browser Use clicks in A8 go through CDP mouse input.
